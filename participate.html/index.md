We are always looking for volunteers to visit us and participate in our studies. We are usually looking for both healthy paticipants and those affected by all stages of wrist injuries, rheumatoid and osteo- arthritis. Please contact our research coordinator, Sam Sutherland, to learn more about how you can participate.
