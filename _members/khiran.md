Khiran Arumugam is a PhD student in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Calgary, supervised by Dr. Sarah Manske. He holds BSc and MSc degrees from McGill and Concordia, with a background in anatomy, exercise science, and experimental medicine. He previously worked on clinical trials at the McGill University Health Centre, focusing on improving musculoskeletal health and self-efficacy in older adults across Canada. Currently, Khiranâ€™s PhD research focuses on leveraging opportunistic CT imaging to investigate muscle loss and weakness in ICU patients. His work aims to link imaging biomarkers, such as muscle cross-sectional area and density, to functional outcomes, ultimately informing rehabilitation strategies for ICU survivors. Outside of work, he enjoys going on runs by the riverside.
