Oyinda completed her Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering at Texas Tech University. During her undergraduate degree, she developed an interest in product design and development. Upon completion of her degree, her work experience in the medical device industry as a R&D engineer motivated her interest to seek an understanding of some of the diseases related to procedures which she designed devices for.
Her research goal is to develop an atlas of cartilage structural and functional properties across different animal models through biomechanics testing and histological analysis with the aim of contributing to osteoarthritis research.
