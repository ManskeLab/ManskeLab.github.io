After graduating from the Cumming School of Medicine with a Bachelor of Health Sciences, Mataea joined the Manske lab as a graduate student co-supervised by Dr. Ashley Harris. Their project aims to use knee osteoarthritis data and advanced spectroscopy techniques to gain insight into brain signaling changes in people with chronic pain. Mataea's previous research has included studies on zebrafish brain development, opioid seeking behaviour in mice, and work with the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging. In their free time, Mataea hosts an experimental music radio show and plays a ridiculous amount of table-top role playing games.
