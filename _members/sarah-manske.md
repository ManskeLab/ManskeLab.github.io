Dr. Manskeâ€™s research focuses on using imaging to better understand the mechanisms that underpin diseases of the musculoskeletal system including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis. Her interests lie in understanding the role of bone in the development and progression of these diseases. She utilizes clinical imaging facilities for human studies in the Centre for Mobility for Joint Health, including high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT), computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, as well as micro-computed tomography and MRI for animal studies. She is an honorary member of the Division of Rheumatology, and also works closely with members of the Division of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr. Manske was awarded a Stars Early Career Development Award from the Arthritis Society to support her work investigating the progression of bone damage in rheumatoid arthritis.
