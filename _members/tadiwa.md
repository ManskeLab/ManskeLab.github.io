Tadiwa’s research focuses on developing and applying methods to quantify bone structure and joint behaviour to better understand the pathophysiological changes and relationships that exist in knee osteoarthritis. As someone with heavy involvement and interest in various sports, Tadiwa has been interested in knee research as it is a frequent site of injury amongst sportspeople. Since OA is a multifactorial disease that can affect adults in both younger and older age groups, Tadiwa’s research looks to characterize the joint-level structural and functional changes that may allow us to differentiate between individuals who are at risk of osteoarthritis initiation and progression.
