Paul Kroliczek is an M.Sc. student in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Calgary, supervised by Dr. Sarah Manske. He holds a B.Sc. in Kinesiology from the University of Calgary and a B.Sc. in Biology with a minor in Biochemistry from Concordia University of Edmonton. After several years in industry, Paul returned to the University of Calgary in 2025 to pursue his Master’s degree under Dr. Manske’s supervision. His research focuses on using CT imaging to investigate muscle loss and weakness in ICU patients, with the goal of advancing methods to quantify muscle fat infiltration and fibrosis through internal calibration techniques to improve measurements of muscle density. Outside of his research, Paul enjoys playing tennis and running, as well as skiing during the winter months.
