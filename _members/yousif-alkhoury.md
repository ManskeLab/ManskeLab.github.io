Yousif is a Master's student supervised by Dr. Sarah Manske and Dr. Ethan MacDonald. Yousif's work investigates the imaging of rheumatoid arthritis using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), a novel and potentially more accessible imaging modality, through an automated image processing pipeline. Yousif's broad interests include medical image registration, segmentation and super-resolution.
Outside the lab, Yousif enjoys hiking and brazillian jiu jitsu.
