## Methodology and Goals

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This project involves developing an atlas of articular cartilage properties obtained from 8 different animals using a universal test method across species. The atlas is developed through the use of biomechanical testing for obtaining properties such as cartilage thickness and stiffness. Additionally, the differences in cartilage morphology are also evaluated through histological analysis using safranin-o and immunofluorescent staining. Understanding the differences in cartilage properties across common osteoarthritis animal models is critical to our potential of developing novel treatments for the disease. This project provides a central location for osteoarthritis researchers to obtain cartilage properties for different animal models utilized for their research needs.
