# Investigating Musculoskeletal Health Through Cutting-Edge Imaging

Welcome to the Manske Lab! We are an interdisciplinary research group in the [McCaig Institute for Bone and Joint Health](https://mccaig.ucalgary.ca) at the [Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary](https://cumming.ucalgary.ca). We are comprised of people with backgrounds in health sciences, kinesiology, and engineering. Our lab uses advanced imaging techniques from the [Centre for Mobility and Joint Health](https://mccaig.ucalgary.ca/research/mojo) to study bone and its contribution to musculoskeletal disease.
