Congratulations to Yousif Al-Khoury for successfully defending his MSc titled "Super-Resolution of Cone Beam Computed Tomography: Applications in Bone Analysis for Rheumatoid Arthritis". Yousif has been so helpful with everything computer-related, helping set students up with ML-based segmentations and GitHub, and setting the website up. We wish Yousif all the best as he pursues his Ph.D. at Concordia University this fall!
